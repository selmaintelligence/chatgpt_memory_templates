# Dynamic Interactive System Template
The Dynamic Interactive System Template is a modular in-memory architecture designed to enable real-time code generation, execution, and user interaction. It includes dynamic memory management, AI-powered code generation, virtual file system handling, and multi-environment simulation, offering a seamless and adaptive user experience for developing and testing code interactively.

## Example Text Prompt Usage
```code
# Step 1: Define a natural language description for the task
description = "Generate a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number."

# Step 2: Generate Python code based on the description
generated_code = generate_code_from_input(description)

# Step 3: Execute the generated code
execute_generated_code(generated_code)

# Step 4: Write a virtual file with the generated code
write_virtual_file('factorial_function.py', generated_code)

# Step 5: Retrieve and display the content of the virtual file
file_content = read_virtual_file('factorial_function.py')
print("File Content:", file_content)

# Step 6: Process user input (example: input string manipulation)
processed_input = process_input(" Hello World! ")
print("Processed Input:", processed_input)

# Step 7: Execute a custom code snippet provided by the user
user_code = """
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

result = factorial(5)
print(result)
"""
run_code(user_code)

# Step 8: Simulate environment interaction
# Switch to Linux environment and run a command
switch_env('linux')
run_command('ls')
```
