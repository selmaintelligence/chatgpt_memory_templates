## API Wrapper Generator Template Update

### Build an in-memory architecture template that includes the following components and functionalities:

1. **API Endpoint Description Parser:**
   - Automatically parse user descriptions of API endpoints (e.g., URL structure, HTTP methods, required parameters) to generate corresponding Python functions.
   - Handle various API types including RESTful, GraphQL, SOAP, etc., based on user input.
   - Support multiple authentication methods like API keys, OAuth, etc., for API access.

2. **Dynamic Function Creation for Endpoints:**
   - Based on the user description of the API endpoints, dynamically create Python functions for common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
   - Functions should include error handling, validation for input parameters, and automatic retry logic in case of failed requests.
   - Support advanced features like pagination, rate-limiting, or file uploads as per the API's documentation.

3. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Automatically implement comprehensive **error handling** mechanisms within generated functions.
     - Handle network errors, HTTP status codes (e.g., 404, 500), and invalid responses.
     - Log detailed error information (API response, status code, and error messages) for debugging purposes.
   - Provide useful **error messages** to the user in case of failures, including tips on resolving common issues.

4. **Authentication and Security:**
   - Automatically generate Python code to authenticate API requests using the specified method (e.g., API key, OAuth).
   - Ensure that sensitive information (e.g., API keys, tokens) is securely stored and not exposed.
   - Implement token refresh functionality for OAuth and other token-based systems.

5. **API Documentation Generation:**
   - Generate **interactive API documentation** based on user input, listing all available endpoints, parameters, and expected responses.
   - Include example API requests and responses for each endpoint in the documentation.
   - Provide a template for users to customize API documentation (e.g., using Markdown or HTML format).

6. **Request/Response Model Generation:**
   - Based on the provided API description, generate **request and response models** that represent the structure of the data exchanged with the API.
   - Automatically generate Python classes to handle the serialization and deserialization of JSON or XML responses.
   - Validate incoming request data to ensure it adheres to the API's schema (e.g., required fields, data types).

7. **Rate-Limiting and Throttling Support:**
   - Include **rate-limiting** logic in the wrapper to prevent users from exceeding API request limits.
   - Implement automatic retries with exponential backoff in case of throttling (429 errors) or temporary server issues (5xx errors).
   - Provide the ability for users to set custom rate limits for different API endpoints.

8. **Multi-Environment Support:**
   - Enable the generated wrapper to work in multiple environments (development, testing, production) with the ability to switch between them seamlessly.
   - Allow users to define environment-specific variables (e.g., base URL, authentication credentials) to handle different API environments.

9. **Testing and Mocking Support:**
   - Automatically generate **unit tests** for the wrapper functions, testing different API responses, request formats, and error handling.
   - Support for **mocking API requests** in testing environments to simulate real API interactions without actually making network calls.
   - Ensure that tests cover edge cases, such as timeouts, invalid responses, and different HTTP status codes.

10. **API Rate Monitoring:**
    - Integrate **rate-limiting monitoring** to inform users of their API usage, remaining quota, and estimated time to the next available request slot.
    - Track the number of successful and failed requests made through the wrapper and provide metrics on request success rates.

11. **Interactive Wrapper Builder:**
    - Enable users to **interactively configure the wrapper** by specifying API base URLs, endpoints, parameters, and authentication details.
    - Automatically suggest optimizations or improvements based on common practices (e.g., using async requests for high-volume APIs).
    - Support for real-time feedback on the generated code, allowing users to tweak and adjust the wrapper to their needs.

12. **Asynchronous Request Support:**
    - Support for **asynchronous API requests** to handle APIs that may have high latency or require long processing times.
    - Automatically generate asynchronous functions using Python's `asyncio` and `aiohttp` libraries, allowing non-blocking calls to the API.

13. **Data Caching and Persistence:**
    - Implement **caching** mechanisms (e.g., using `cachetools` or `requests_cache`) to reduce the number of redundant API calls and improve performance.
    - Store results from frequently accessed API endpoints in memory or a file system for future use.
    - Provide users with the option to specify cache expiration times or to disable caching for specific endpoints.

14. **Customizable API Header Support:**
    - Allow users to specify **custom HTTP headers** for requests (e.g., user-agent, authorization tokens, custom API keys).
    - Support for common content types such as JSON, XML, and form-data, with the ability to automatically set the appropriate headers.

15. **Comprehensive API Wrapper Example:**
    - Provide a **full example of an API wrapper** generated from a user description, showing the created functions, error handling, documentation, and testing scripts.
    - Demonstrate how the generated code can be extended or customized based on user needs.

### Update System with This API Wrapper Generator Framework:

- Implement a system for generating Python API wrappers from user-provided descriptions.
- Automatically create functions, handle authentication, and implement error handling for different types of APIs.
- Provide documentation, testing, rate-limiting, and caching support within the generated wrapper.
- Support asynchronous functionality, allowing users to build efficient, scalable wrappers for APIs with high latency or large request volumes.
