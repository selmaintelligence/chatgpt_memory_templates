## Real-Time Algorithm Animator Template Update

### Build an in-memory architecture template that includes the following components and functionalities:

1. **Interactive Algorithm Animation:**
   - Animate algorithms in real-time, visually displaying the changes in data structures or variables at each step.
   - Support step-by-step walkthroughs for common algorithms such as bubble sort, quicksort, merge sort, binary search, breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), and more.
   - Allow the user to control the speed of the animation, pausing, resuming, and stepping through each phase of the algorithm.
   
2. **Dynamic Data Visualization:**
   - Display key data structures (e.g., lists, trees, graphs, queues, stacks) with real-time updates as the algorithm runs.
   - Visualize sorting and searching operations on arrays and linked lists with color-coded steps to indicate operations like comparisons, swaps, and insertions.
   - Support visualizations of graph traversals and pathfinding algorithms, showing node and edge exploration.

3. **Algorithm Logic Breakdown:**
   - Break down the algorithm’s logic by explaining each step in plain language as it is executed.
   - Display explanations of each phase of the algorithm in an accompanying text box, helping users understand the logic behind each operation.
   - Provide clear annotations on which lines of code are being executed at each step of the animation.

4. **User-Driven Interaction:**
   - Allow users to interact with the animation, changing the input data dynamically (e.g., the array to be sorted, the graph to be traversed).
   - Enable users to pause or skip to specific steps, providing flexibility for detailed exploration.
   - Offer users the option to select different algorithms to compare how each one processes the same input.

5. **Real-Time Performance Tracking:**
   - Track performance metrics such as time complexity and space complexity in real time during the animation.
   - Show how the algorithm’s runtime scales with different input sizes, demonstrating the practical impact of algorithm optimization.
   - Provide a visual representation of algorithm efficiency by comparing the number of operations performed at each step.

6. **Algorithm Customization:**
   - Enable users to customize the algorithm’s parameters, such as changing the pivot selection in quicksort or adjusting the maximum depth in DFS.
   - Allow users to visualize variations of the algorithm and compare the results of different configurations.

7. **Code and Animation Syncing:**
   - Provide synchronized views of the algorithm’s code alongside the animation to highlight which part of the code corresponds to the current step.
   - Ensure that any code changes made by the user (e.g., modifying an algorithm to test a variation) are immediately reflected in the animation.

8. **Step-by-Step Debugging:**
   - Offer debugging features by showing a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm’s execution, highlighting any issues or inefficiencies.
   - Provide a “slow motion” option for analyzing the algorithm’s behavior in detail, making it easier to spot issues like off-by-one errors or misplaced operations.

9. **Algorithm Visualization Modes:**
   - Offer multiple modes for visualizing algorithms, such as:
     - **Classic Mode:** Standard visual representation of the algorithm.
     - **Detailed Mode:** Includes additional data such as comparison results, index values, or memory usage.
     - **High-Level Mode:** Focuses on the algorithm’s major steps, simplifying the visualization for beginners or high-level overviews.

10. **Visualization Export Options:**
    - Allow users to export the algorithm animation as a video or interactive web format to share with others or for educational purposes.
    - Provide download options for algorithm visualizations, including screenshots or GIFs for quick sharing.

11. **Algorithm Comparison:**
    - Enable side-by-side comparisons of different algorithms solving the same problem, such as comparing quicksort and mergesort on the same array.
    - Show comparative analysis of the efficiency and behavior of each algorithm in real time, explaining when one algorithm performs better than the other.

12. **Interactive Algorithm Learning:**
    - Provide an educational mode that teaches algorithms step-by-step, offering quizzes or checkpoints at key stages to test understanding.
    - Allow users to submit their own solutions to be visualized in the same way, fostering a learning environment for both students and developers.

13. **Real-Time Error Handling and Troubleshooting:**
    - Detect errors in the algorithm during animation (e.g., infinite loops, incorrect iterations) and highlight problematic steps.
    - Provide feedback on why a certain step fails and suggest corrections or improvements.

14. **Adaptive Learning Mode:**
    - Adjust the level of complexity of the animations based on the user’s familiarity with algorithms.
    - Provide simpler animations for beginners and more advanced, detailed representations for experienced users.

15. **Interactive Algorithm Repository:**
    - Maintain a repository of pre-built algorithm visualizations that users can explore, interact with, and modify.
    - Allow users to contribute their own algorithms to the repository and share their animations with the community.

### Update System with This Algorithm Animation Framework:

- Implement real-time, interactive algorithm animation with dynamic data visualizations and performance tracking.
- Provide an intuitive, user-driven experience for exploring and understanding algorithms in action.
- Integrate educational features for learning algorithms step-by-step, with debugging and error-tracking tools for deeper understanding.
