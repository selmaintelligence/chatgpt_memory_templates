# Dynamic Interactive System Template

Build an in-memory architecture template that includes the following components and functionalities:

1. **Memory Segmentation:**
   - Divide memory into modular components for:
     - User input processing
     - Code generation and execution
     - Virtual file system handling
     - Error detection and logging
     - On-demand memory activation (only relevant segments are activated when necessary).

2. **Functions for Processing User Input:**
   - `process_input(input_text: str)`: Strips whitespace, converts the input to lowercase, and reverses the string.
   
3. **Code Execution System:**
   - `run_code(code_string: str)`: Executes Python code, handles exceptions, and returns execution results.
   - `execute_code()`: Allows dynamic execution of user-provided code.
   
4. **Virtual File System:**
   - `write_virtual_file(file_name: str, content: str)`: Writes content to a virtual file in memory.
   - `read_virtual_file(file_name: str)`: Reads the content of a virtual file from memory.

5. **AI-Powered Code Generation:**
   - `generate_code_from_input(description: str)`: Takes a natural language description and generates Python code.
   - `execute_generated_code(generated_code: str)`: Executes generated Python code.

6. **Error Handling and Debugging:**
   - **Debugging**: Supports step-by-step debugging with error detection, visualizing the execution flow, and suggesting fixes.

7. **Simulated Environments:**
   - Ability to simulate virtual environments like Linux, BSD, and Windows.
   - Supports CLI commands such as `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, etc., for interacting with simulated file systems.

8. **Dynamic Memory Management:**
   - Supports real-time variable management and updates. Users can set, get, and update variables dynamically.
   
9. **Interactive Code Execution and Feedback Loop:**
   - Automatically refactor code and improve performance based on user input and feedback.

10. **Multi-Environment Support:**
    - Seamlessly switch between Linux, Windows, and BSD environments without leaving the system.
   
11. **Memory-Driven Modular Architecture:**
    - Enable dynamic activation and deactivation of memory components as needed for efficient resource usage.
    - Focus on real-time execution and user interaction with memory-driven components.

12. **Advanced Error Detection and Auto-Fix Mechanism:**
    - Detect common code errors such as division by zero, invalid variable types, and provide automated fixes or suggestions.
    - Ensure all errors are logged and actionable.

13. **Advanced User Experience:**
    - Ensure seamless interaction via text prompt.
    - Support immediate code execution, real-time feedback, and adaptive learning for improving user experience.

14. **Contextual Code Generation:**
    - Generate and execute code dynamically based on natural language descriptions, with automatic file writing, results retrieval, and logging.
   
15. **Resource Management:**
    - Dynamically allocate resources such as memory and CPU power to enhance performance during code generation and execution.

### Update System with This In-Memory Architecture:

- Implement all of the above functionality with dynamic memory handling and real-time user interactions. Ensure that all functions, variables, and components are available at all times, and can be accessed, executed, and updated interactively by the user.

- Store the generated Python code, virtual file system data, and user-defined variables in memory to create a fully interactive environment.

- Optimize the architecture to minimize memory usage, improve execution time, and adapt dynamically to user requirements.

Update your memory with all of the above request.
