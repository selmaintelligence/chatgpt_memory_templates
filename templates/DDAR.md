## Dynamic Data Analysis and Reporting Update Template

### Build an in-memory architecture template that includes the following components and functionalities:

1. **Real-Time Data Analysis:**
   - Automatically analyze datasets upon receiving them in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, Excel).
   - Support data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, filtering data, and normalizing values.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends, correlations, and outliers.
   - Provide real-time updates on data summaries (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).

2. **Data Visualization Tools:**
   - **Real-Time Visualizations**: Generate real-time visualizations like bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and line graphs based on user input and data.
   - **Customizable Charts**: Allow users to customize the appearance of charts (e.g., color schemes, axis labels, titles, etc.).
   - **Interactive Visualizations**: Provide interactive visualizations that enable users to zoom, filter, or click on chart elements for deeper analysis.
   - **Graphical Representation of Metrics**: Display the results of data analysis (e.g., trends, patterns) in a graphical form.

3. **Comprehensive Reporting:**
   - **Customizable Reports**: Automatically generate reports with user-defined metrics and visualizations.
   - Include key performance indicators (KPIs), statistical summaries, data trends, and charts.
   - **Export Options**: Allow users to export reports in multiple formats such as PDF, CSV, and Excel.
   - **Automated Insights**: Generate automated textual insights based on the analysis, such as "The sales have increased by 15% in the last quarter."

4. **User-Defined Metrics:**
   - Let users specify which metrics they want to include in their report (e.g., median income, max sales, etc.).
   - Automatically calculate these metrics and present them in the report alongside the data visualizations.

5. **Data Aggregation and Grouping:**
   - Provide functionality for grouping data by different attributes (e.g., by region, product category, etc.) and summarizing the results.
   - Enable custom aggregation (e.g., summing, averaging, counting) across different data groups.

6. **Trend and Forecast Analysis:**
   - Apply statistical models (e.g., linear regression, time series forecasting) to predict future trends based on historical data.
   - Automatically display trend lines or forecast data on visualizations.

7. **Data Export and Sharing:**
   - Enable easy export of both raw datasets and processed reports.
   - Provide sharing capabilities for reports and charts with links or direct export options.

8. **Interactive Analysis Session:**
   - Allow users to interact with data during the analysis process, such as filtering rows, applying transformations, or modifying chart parameters in real time.

9. **Integration with External Data Sources:**
   - Automatically pull data from external sources such as APIs or databases (e.g., SQL, NoSQL) for real-time analysis and reporting.
   - Integrate with cloud storage solutions to import and analyze datasets stored on platforms like Google Drive, AWS S3, or Dropbox.

10. **Real-Time Collaboration:**
    - Enable multiple users to collaborate on a single dataset or report, providing real-time changes and updates.
    - Provide version control for datasets and reports to track modifications over time.

### Update System with This Dynamic Data Analysis and Reporting Framework:

- Implement all of the above functionalities for analyzing datasets, generating visualizations, and creating reports automatically.
- Allow for real-time interaction with data and visualizations.
- Enable easy export, sharing, and collaboration on data analysis and reporting tasks, with customizable metrics and graphical representations.

Update your memory with all of the above requests.

## Example Text Prompt Usage:
```code
Analyze the dataset and generate a report with sales trends for the last year, including a line chart and key performance indicators." "Provide a summary of the customer demographics with visualizations of age distribution and geographic locations." "Generate a forecast for next quarter's sales based on the historical data provided and create an exportable report.
```
