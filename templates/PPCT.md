## Python Package Creator Template Update

### Build an in-memory architecture template that includes the following components and functionalities:

1. **Package Structure Generation:**
   - Automatically generate the folder structure for a Python package based on user input. This structure should include:
     - `setup.py`: The installation and configuration script for the package.
     - `README.md`: A markdown file containing information about the package.
     - `LICENSE`: A license file template.
     - `requirements.txt`: A list of dependencies for the package.
     - `tests/`: A directory for unit tests and test cases.
     - `src/`: The source code directory where the core functionality of the package resides.
   
2. **Setup Script Generation (`setup.py`):**
   - Generate a `setup.py` script for the Python package, configuring essential information like:
     - Package name
     - Version
     - Author and email
     - Dependencies
     - License type
     - Entry points (e.g., CLI commands, scripts)
     - URL to the project repository
   - Automatically include any additional metadata provided by the user such as long description, keywords, classifiers, etc.

3. **Documentation Generation (README.md):**
   - Create a template for the `README.md` file that includes:
     - Package description
     - Installation instructions
     - Usage examples
     - Contribution guidelines
     - License and author information
   - Allow customization of sections based on the userâ€™s input (e.g., custom instructions, features, or examples).

4. **Test Cases and Unit Tests:**
   - Automatically generate basic unit tests within the `tests/` directory using `unittest` or `pytest`.
     - Create a test file for the core functionality of the package.
     - Include boilerplate test cases for common functionalities, such as basic functionality checks and edge case tests.
   - Allow the user to define custom test cases or tweak automatically generated ones.

5. **Requirements File Generation (`requirements.txt`):**
   - Generate the `requirements.txt` file based on user input, listing required external libraries and dependencies (e.g., NumPy, requests, Flask).
   - Allow the user to add custom dependencies manually if necessary.
   - Include version constraints for dependencies when requested.

6. **Licensing and Legal Setup:**
   - Provide a customizable LICENSE file with common open-source licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL).
   - Allow the user to select a license type when setting up the package and automatically add it to the package structure.

7. **CLI Integration:**
   - Optionally include a basic CLI integration within the `setup.py` file, allowing the user to define command-line entry points for their package.
   - Allow users to specify command names and corresponding functions to be linked directly from the terminal.

8. **Package Publishing Setup:**
   - Generate `pyproject.toml` for compatibility with modern Python build systems.
   - Provide guidance for publishing the package to PyPI (Python Package Index) by including appropriate metadata in the setup script.
   - Provide a step-by-step guide on how to upload the package to PyPI (e.g., using `twine`).

9. **Version Control Setup:**
   - Include basic setup for version control (e.g., `.gitignore` for ignoring unnecessary files, such as `__pycache__/` and virtual environment directories).
   - Provide template configuration for initializing a Git repository if desired.

10. **Package Customization:**
    - Allow users to customize each file within the generated package structure, from adding custom sections in the `README.md` to defining the package's entry points and dependencies.
    - Enable users to select specific templates for documentation, test cases, or even example scripts based on their intended package type (e.g., data analysis, web development, machine learning).

11. **Interactive Guidance for Package Features:**
    - Provide step-by-step guidance in the form of interactive prompts for users who need help creating their package.
    - Based on user inputs (e.g., package type, dependencies), suggest default setups or configurations to accelerate the process.

12. **Version Control Integration:**
    - Automatically initialize a Git repository for the Python package, create an initial commit, and set up remote connections for platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
    - Include templates for `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` files to manage version control effectively.

13. **Template Export:**
    - Provide users with the option to export the entire Python package structure as a zip file or directly integrate with GitHub for version control.
    - Allow users to download the generated package template with all necessary files included.

14. **Example Template for Data Science Package:**
    - Automatically generate the structure for a data science package that includes folders for `data/`, `notebooks/`, and a `requirements.txt` for scientific libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

15. **Package Validation and Testing:**
    - After package creation, run basic tests to validate that the package is set up correctly (e.g., ensure that `setup.py` can be run without errors).
    - Verify that the package structure follows conventions and is ready for distribution.

### Update System with This Python Package Creation Framework:

- Implement the Python package creation framework with dynamic file generation based on user input.
- Ensure real-time customization and testing of the package files and their contents.
- Store the generated files and templates for future retrieval and modification by the user.
