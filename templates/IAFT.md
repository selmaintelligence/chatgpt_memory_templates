## Intelligent Automation Framework Update Template

### Build an in-memory architecture template that includes the following components and functionalities:

1. **Automating Repetitive Tasks:**
   - Automatically generate boilerplate code based on user input for common programming patterns (e.g., API skeletons, class definitions, etc.).
   - Create standard project structures (e.g., folder setups, file templates, etc.) for different programming languages or frameworks.
   - Configure development environments (e.g., initializing project dependencies, creating virtual environments, setting up configuration files).

2. **Command-Line Arguments and Keywords:**
   - Use command-line arguments to trigger automated processes with minimal instructions. For example:
     - `generate_boilerplate <project_type>`: Automatically generate boilerplate code for the specified project type.
     - `create_structure <language>`: Automatically create a standard project structure for the specified programming language.
     - `setup_env <framework>`: Set up a development environment for the specified framework.

3. **Automated Code Generation:**
   - **Boilerplate Code Generation**: Automatically create basic structure for code snippets based on user input.
   - **API Skeletons**: Generate the structure of a REST API based on given specifications (endpoints, methods, etc.).
   - **Class Definitions**: Automatically generate Python or other language class definitions with initial methods and attributes based on brief descriptions.

4. **Project Setup Automation:**
   - **Project Structure Creation**: Automatically generate project directories and files (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, `README.md`, `requirements.txt`).
   - **Environment Setup**: Automatically set up development environments (e.g., `virtualenv`, `pipenv`, `docker`).
   - **Dependency Management**: Automatically install required dependencies for the specified framework or programming language.

5. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Automatically configure project settings (e.g., version control integration, linter setup, pre-commit hooks, etc.).
   - Create configuration files (e.g., `.gitignore`, `eslint.json`, `docker-compose.yml`).

6. **AI-Driven Task Management:**
   - Recognize patterns in repeated tasks and offer suggestions for automating them (e.g., automating deployment processes, code formatting, etc.).
   - Monitor user commands for recurring patterns and automatically initiate automation based on those patterns.

7. **Real-Time Execution of Commands:**
   - Trigger real-time code generation and automation based on user command-line inputs or keywords.
   - Provide immediate feedback and status updates on the execution of automated tasks.

8. **Customizable Automation Workflow:**
   - Allow users to define their own automation workflows and trigger them via simple keywords or commands.
   - Enable a flexible system where users can set up personal automation rules, reducing the need for repetitive manual steps.

9. **Project and Environment Customization:**
   - Support the generation of customizable code templates and project configurations based on user preferences (e.g., styling conventions, preferred libraries).
   - Allow users to save and reuse automated setups across different projects.

10. **Integration with External Tools:**
    - Integrate with external tools like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to automate repository creation and setup.
    - Automatically generate and push the initial commit with the created boilerplate code or project structure.

### Update System with This Intelligent Automation Framework:

- Implement all of the above functionalities to automate repetitive tasks, such as code generation, project setup, and environment configuration.
- Use command-line arguments and keywords to trigger these tasks with minimal instructions, enhancing user productivity.
- Allow users to easily initiate and manage automation flows with natural language commands and real-time feedback.

Update your memory with all of the above requests.
