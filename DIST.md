For convenience the raw markdown is included here. As well, in a separate markdown template for easier access when dealing with ChatGPT's API dynamically. if you do not wish to have a copy and paste party, you can get the raw file link from above. 

## Examples
### 1. Memory Segmentation:
Purpose: Segments of memory can be activated or deactivated dynamically to improve resource efficiency and manage memory usage based on the task at hand.
#### Example:
```code
"Activate the memory segment for virtual file management."
"Deactivate the memory segment for code execution."
```

### 2. User Input Processing:
Purpose: This function handles text input by processing, stripping whitespace, and optionally performing formatting or transformations based on requirements.
#### Example:
```code
"Process and format this input: ' Make this text cleaner! '"
"Strip all spaces from the input: ' Python code '"
```

### 3. Code Execution System:
Purpose: This executes Python code, handles exceptions, and returns the execution result. It also supports dynamic execution of user-provided code.
#### Example:
```code
"Run the following code and return the result: a = 5; b = 10; print(a + b)"
"Execute the following function and print the result: def multiply(x, y): return x * y."
```

### 4. Virtual File System Management:
Purpose: Manages virtual files by allowing users to write data to and read from files stored in memory.
#### Example:
```code
"Write the text 'File data stored here' to a virtual file named data.txt."
"Retrieve the content of the virtual file data.txt."
```

### 5. Error Detection and Logging:
Purpose: Detects common code errors like invalid types, division by zero, etc., and logs these errors with actionable suggestions for fixing them.
#### Example:
```code
"Detect errors in the following code: a = 5; b = 0; print(a / b)."
"Log and suggest fixes for this code: x = 'string'; y = 10; print(x + y)."
```

### 6. Dynamic Memory Management:
Purpose: Manages memory in real time by tracking and adjusting variables and resource usage to optimize performance and avoid wastage.
#### Example:
```code
"Update the variable x to 15 and adjust memory usage accordingly."
"Allocate memory dynamically for processing this large dataset."
```

### 7. Interactive Code Execution and Feedback Loop:
Purpose: Executes code dynamically and provides real-time feedback for improving code performance or making changes based on specific feedback.
#### Example:
```code
"Execute the following code and provide feedback for improvements: for i in range(100000): print(i)."
"Run this code and suggest how it could be refactored for better performance."
```

### 8. Advanced Error Detection and Auto-Fix Mechanism:
Purpose:  This detects common errors and offers automated suggestions for fixing issues, such as syntax errors or invalid variable types.
#### Example:
```code
"Fix the type error in this code: a = 'Hello'; b = 5; print(a + b)."
"Automatically detect and fix this common error: x = 'test'; print(x * 'abc')."
```

### 9. Contextual Code Generation:
Purpose: Converts natural language descriptions into Python code that can be executed and tested.
#### Example:
```code
"Generate Python code for the task: 'Create a function to check if a number is prime.'"
"Write Python code for the description: 'Create a program to read input from a file and calculate the sum of all numbers inside it.'"
```

### 10. Resource Management:
Purpose: Dynamically allocates memory and CPU resources based on the task's demands to optimize performance during code generation and execution.
#### Example:
```code
"Allocate additional resources for executing a complex function."
"Ensure minimal CPU usage when processing large arrays."
```

### 11. Memory-Driven Modular Architecture:
Purpose: Activates or deactivates memory segments based on the user's needs, ensuring efficient resource use by loading only the required components at any given time.
#### Example:
```code
"Activate the code execution segment and deactivate the virtual file system segment to save resources."
"Enable the memory segment for dynamic resource allocation."
```

### 12. Advanced User Experience:
Purpose:  Ensures smooth and intuitive user interaction by providing immediate feedback and adaptive learning for an enhanced experience.
#### Example:
```code
"Adjust the interface to display real-time suggestions based on user input."
"Optimize the user experience for smoother transitions between tasks."
```

### 13. Dynamic Architecture:
Purpose:  Implements all the system components, ensuring real-time handling of memory, code execution, and user interactions while adapting to evolving user needs.
#### Example:
```code
"Allow dynamic updates to the code execution segment based on real-time user requests."
"Ensure all system components are seamlessly connected and interact in real time."
```
