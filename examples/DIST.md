# Dynamic Interactive System Template

Design an in-memory architecture template that includes the following components and functionalities:

1. Memory Segmentation:

    Modular Memory Segments:
        User Input Processing
        Code Execution and Debugging
        Virtual File System Management
        Error Detection and Logging
        Dynamic Memory Activation (Segments activated on-demand for efficiency)

2. User Input Processing:

    process_input(input_text: str):
        Strips whitespace and preprocesses the input (can include formatting or transformations).

3. Code Execution System:

    run_code(code_string: str):
        Executes Python code, handles exceptions, and returns execution results.
    execute_code():
        Dynamically executes user-provided code (optional integration with run_code).

4. Virtual File System Management:

    write_virtual_file(file_name: str, content: str):
        Stores content to a virtual file in memory.
    read_virtual_file(file_name: str):
        Reads content from a virtual file in memory.

5. Error Handling and Debugging:

    Error Detection:
        Detect common code errors (e.g., division by zero, invalid variable types).
    Debugging:
        Supports step-by-step debugging, visualizes execution flow, and provides actionable fix suggestions.

6. Dynamic Memory Management:

    Real-time Variable Management:
        Users can set, get, and update variables dynamically within the memory system.
    Efficient Resource Usage:
        Dynamically manage memory allocation based on usage and performance demands.

7. Interactive Code Execution and Feedback Loop:

    Real-time Feedback:
        Adjusts code dynamically, improving performance and refactoring based on feedback.

8. Advanced Error Detection and Auto-Fix Mechanism:

    Automated Fix Suggestions:
        Detect and provide fixes or suggestions for common errors (invalid types, syntax errors, etc.).
    Error Logging:
        Ensure all errors are logged with actionable insights.

9. Contextual Code Generation:

    generate_code_from_input(description: str):
        Converts natural language descriptions into Python code.
    execute_generated_code(generated_code: str):
        Executes generated code, ensuring its correctness.

10. Resource Management:

    Dynamic Resource Allocation:
        Allocate memory and CPU resources dynamically for performance optimization during code generation and execution.

11. Memory-Driven Modular Architecture:

    Activate/Deactivate Segments:
        Memory segments activate only when required to optimize resource usage.
    Unified System Design:
        Modular, interconnected components with workflows that focus on code execution, memory handling, and real-time interaction.

12. Advanced User Experience:

    Seamless Interaction:
        Enable smooth, intuitive user interactions with immediate code execution and adaptive learning for improved experience.

13. Implementation of Dynamic Architecture:

    Implement all components with real-time memory handling, code execution, and user interaction.
    Ensure the ability to access, execute, and update all components interactively by the user.
    Minimize memory usage, improve execution speed, and adapt dynamically to user needs.

System Architecture Overview:

    Memory Management: Components of the system can be activated/deactivated dynamically to manage resource use effectively.
    Error Detection & Feedback: Real-time error detection and debugging, alongside automated fixes for common issues.
    Real-Time Code Execution: User input and generated code are executed on-demand, allowing for instant feedback and interaction.
    Optimized User Experience: Simplified, coherent functionality that prioritizes performance, ease of use, and memory efficiency.

### Notes:
For convenience the raw markdown is included here. As well, in a separate markdown template for easier access when dealing with ChatGPT's API dynamically. if you do not wish to have a copy and paste party,you can get the raw link from above. 

## Template Functionality & Examples
### 1. Memory Segmentation:
Purpose: Segments of memory can be activated or deactivated dynamically to improve resource efficiency and manage memory usage based on the task at hand.
#### Example:
```code
"Activate the memory segment for virtual file management."
"Deactivate the memory segment for code execution."
```
