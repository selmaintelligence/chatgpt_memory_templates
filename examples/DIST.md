# Dynamic Interactive System Template
The Dynamic Interactive System template is an advanced, modular architecture designed for efficient memory and resource management, real-time code execution, and seamless user interaction. It features memory segmentation that activates components on-demand, dynamic error detection and automated fixes, and an interactive feedback loop for real-time code improvement. The system includes components for user input processing, virtual file management, code execution, and dynamic memory allocation, all designed to optimize performance while providing an adaptive and intuitive experience. The architecture is flexible, with memory-driven modular segments that activate only when needed, ensuring efficient use of resources.

## Template Functionality & Examples
### 1. Memory Segmentation:
Purpose: Segments of memory can be activated or deactivated dynamically to improve resource efficiency and manage memory usage based on the task at hand.
#### Example:
```code
"Activate the memory segment for virtual file management."
"Deactivate the memory segment for code execution."
```
